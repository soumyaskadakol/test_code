Project 1: Crop & Weed Detection  
- *Problem*: Weeds reduce sesame crop yield and excessive pesticide spraying is harmful.  
- *Solution: YOLOv5 object detection model trained on **1300 sesame plant images* to detect weeds and enable selective spraying.  
- *Dataset*: 1300 images (collected, cleaned, resized, augmented, labeled in YOLO format).  
- *Technology*: Python, PyTorch, YOLOv5, OpenCV.  
- *Performance: Achieved *~90% mAP**, Precision ~88%, Recall ~85%.  

Project 2: Smart City Traffic Patterns Forecasting  
- *Problem*: Traffic congestion during peak hours, holidays, and special events is a challenge for cities.  
- *Solution*: Machine Learning models (Random Forest, LSTM) used to forecast traffic patterns.  
- *Dataset*: Traffic volume dataset with features like junction, time, weekday, holiday.  
- *Technology*: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib.  
- *Performance*:  
  - Random Forest: *85% accuracy (RÂ² Score)*  
  - LSTM: *88% accuracy*, better for time-series.
